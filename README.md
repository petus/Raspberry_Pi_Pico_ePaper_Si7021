# Raspberry_Pi_Pico_ePaper_Si7021
Example code for Raspberry Pi Pico with 4.2" b/w/r ePaper and Si7021 

The exmple code used the existing libraries for Micropython 

Dominik Kapusta: micropython-waveshare-epd - https://github.com/ayoy/micropython-waveshare-epd

Mike Causer: micropython-waveshare-epaper - https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-waveshare-epaper

I merged both libraries to one. I'm able to use 4.2" b/w/r and easily change the text font.
